A/B Testing – Hypothesis Testing (Python)

This project performs A/B Testing to compare room rent between Control (A) and Test (B) groups.

Tools Used:
Python, Google Colab, pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib

Method:
An independent t-test was applied with alpha = 0.05 to compare the mean room rent of both groups.

Results:
Control Mean: 8133.33
Test Mean: 9125.00
p-value: 1.04e-08

Conclusion:
The null hypothesis was rejected.
There is a statistically significant difference between the two groups.
The Test group performs better than the Control group.
